# Final_Scout

What is the purpose of this ?

-This Scout Report API is my final project for the QA Software developement bootcamp to showcase the skills I have gained throughout the bootcamp


Challenges I expect

- I expect various testing bugs and issues, I am sure that most will be due to small typing errors. I also expect some issues using Git bash and GitHub

What went well and didn't 

- The making of the main classes went smoothly and with very few bugs
- When pushing the files to GitHub I experienced some issues, lost some files and Eclipse no longer had access to most files, had to troubleshoot this for a while.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project

- Learn and study more about the use of git hub and how it uses the files in order to prevent any delays and issues. 

- All the Testing images have been pushed up to github, they have their own folder

**********-IMPORTANT- Risk Assesment is in the same folder as the testing images.**************
